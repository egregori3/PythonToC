## Python Slicing
https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.indexing.html

Basic slicing extends Python’s basic concept of slicing to N dimensions. Basic slicing occurs when obj is a slice object (constructed by start:stop:step notation inside of brackets), an integer, or a tuple of slice objects and integers. Ellipsis and newaxis objects can be interspersed with these as well.

The basic slice syntax is i:j:k where i is the starting index, j is the stopping index, and k is the step (k≠0). This selects the m elements (in the corresponding dimension) with index values i, i + k, …, i + (m - 1) k where m=q+(r≠0) and q and r are the quotient and remainder obtained by dividing j - i by k: j - i = q k + r, so that i + (m - 1) k < j.

Negative i and j are interpreted as n + i and n + j where n is the number of elements in the corresponding dimension. Negative k makes stepping go towards smaller indices.

### C Array
For a C array of size array[a][b], array[c][d] accesses the same element as array[(c*b)+d]; b is referred to as stride.
